# MyToken Smart Contract

This repository contains a simple Ethereum ERC20 token smart contract called `mytoken_deploy`. The contract is built using the Solidity programming language and inherits functionalities from the OpenZeppelin `ERC20` contract.

## Overview

The `mytoken_deploy` contract is an implementation of the ERC20 token standard, which allows for the creation of fungible tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. This contract includes basic features such as token minting, burning, and transfers. It also incorporates the OpenZeppelin `ERC20` contract to ensure security and standard compliance.

## Features

- Minting: The contract owner can mint new tokens and allocate them to a specified address.

- Burning: Token holders can burn their tokens, reducing the total supply.

- Transfer: Token holders can transfer tokens between addresses, while maintaining accurate balances.
